# hsc3-x11

## ptr midi-osc

Translate mouse motion into MIDI CC data.

Scaling is per-dimension, so that the maximum value is (1,1).

# ptr trace

Record trace of X mouse cursor as a three column `CSV` file.  The time
is in seconds, and the `x` and `y` values are normalised in (0,1).

The normalisation can be:

u = uniform, ie. _not_ per dimension, so the maximum value will not be
(1,1) unless the screen is square.

n = non-uniform, ie. per dimension, so that the maximum value is (1,1).
