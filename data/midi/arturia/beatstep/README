This directory contains Sysex files to edit an Arturia BeatStep Usb/Midi controller.

The Sysex files may contain multiple Sysex messages.

To send using `amidi` (editing the port variable, see `amidi -l`):

~~~~
$ export port=hw:1,0,0
$ amidi -p $port -i 1 -s enc-seq-i00-rel.syx
$ amidi -p $port -i 1 -s led-all-red.syx
$ amidi -p $port -i 1 -s led-all-blue.syx
$ amidi -p $port -i 1 -s led-all-off.syx
$
~~~~

To send using `midi-osc-pm` (editing the port variable, see `midi-osc-pm stat`):

~~~~
$ export port=1
$ midi-osc-pm sysex send 1 $port < enc-seq-c00-i00-abs.syx
$ midi-osc-pm sysex send 1 $port < led-all-blue.syx
$ midi-osc-pm sysex send 1 $port < led-all-off.syx
$
~~~~

The Sysex files are:

- enc-seq-index-mode: set all encoders to send Cc messages at consecutive indices starting at _index_
- led-all-state: set all led to state (red, blue, magenta, off)
- led-cntrl-seq-off: turn off cntrl/seq led
- led-pad-index-state: set led at pad index to state
- pad-seq-cc-index-mode: set all pads to send Cc messages at consecutive indices starting at index
- pad-seq-mn-index-mode: set all pads to send mnn messages at consecutive indices starting at index

The enc and pad files follow the global channel setting (set using chan+pad on device).

Encoder modes are: abs = absolute values, rel = relative values (centre 0x40)

Pad Cc modes are: sw1 = on/off (maintained switch), sw2 = on/off (momentary switch), prs = pressure

Pad Mn modes are: cs = on/off (consecutive presses), rl = on/off (on release)

The module has code for the following variants (not stored):

- enc-seq-channel-index-mode: variant setting fixed output channel
- pad-seq-channel-index-mode: variant setting fixed output channel
