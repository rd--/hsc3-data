This directory contains SYSEX files to edit an Arturia BeatStep USB/MIDI controller.

The SYSEX files may contain multiple SYSEX messages.

To send usinf `amidi` (debian) use (editing the ADDR variable, see `amidi -l`):

~~~~
$ export PORT=hw:1,0,0
$ amidi -p $PORT -i 1 -s enc-seq-I00-REL.syx
$ amidi -p $PORT -i 1 -s led-all-red.syx
$ amidi -p $PORT -i 1 -s led-all-blue.syx
$ amidi -p $PORT -i 1 -s led-all-off.syx
$
~~~~

To send using `midi-osc-pm` (editing the PORT variable, see `midi-osc-pm stat`):

~~~~
$ export PORT=1
$ midi-osc-pm sysex send 1 $PORT < enc-seq-C00-I00-ABS.syx
$ midi-osc-pm sysex send 1 $PORT < led-all-blue.syx
$ midi-osc-pm sysex send 1 $PORT < led-all-off.syx
$

The SYSEX files are:

- enc-seq-INDEX-MODE: set all encoders to send CC messages at consecutive indices starting at INDEX
- led-all-STATE: set all LED to STATE (RED, BLUE, MAGENTA, OFF)
- led-cntrl-seq-off: turn off CNTRL/SEQ LED
- led-pad-INDEX-STATE: set LED at pad INDEX to STATE
- pad-seq-cc-INDEX-MODE: set all pads to send CC messages at consecutive indices starting at INDEX
- pad-seq-mn-INDEX-MODE: set all pads to send MNN messages at consecutive indices starting at INDEX

The ENC and PAD files follow the global channel setting (set using CHAN+PAD on device).

Encoder modes are: ABS = absolute values, REL = relative values (centre 0x40)

Pad CC modes are: SW1 = ON/OFF (consecutive presses), SW2 = ON/OFF (on release), PRS = pressure

Pad MN modes are: CS = ON/OFF (consecutive presses), RL = ON/OFF (on release)

The module has code for the following variants (not stored):

- enc-seq-CHANNEL-INDEX-MODE: variant setting fixed output channel
- pad-seq-CHANNEL-INDEX-MODE: variant setting fixed output channel
